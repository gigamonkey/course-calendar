- What is data? (1)

  - What can we do with it?

    - Render it: play a video, display text, etc.

    - Store it

    - Send and receive it

    - Combine and transform it to make new data

  - What is a data type?

    - A set of possible values

    - Syntax - how you write it

    - Operators - what you can do with it

    - Expressions - combinatios of values and operators

- First three data types (3)

  - Numbers

    - Possible values

    - Syntax

    - Possible values

    - Syntax

  - Booleans

    - Possible values

    - Syntax

  - Operators

    - On numbers: +, -, *, /

    - On strings: +, []

    - On booleans: &&, ||, !

    - Between types, e.g. ===, <, etc.

- Expressions
